Automatically assign reviewers at random and notify them on Discord!

## How to Install on Your Repository

### Create Discord Webhook URL

> [!NOTE]
> To create a Webhook, you should be the adminðŸ‘‘ or have the `Manage Webhooks` permission.

1. In your Discord server, go to **Server Settings** and click **Integrations**.
1. Click **Webhooks**.
1. If you haven't created any webhooks, a new webhook will be created automatically. If not, click **New Webhook**.
1. Change the name and profile picture as you like. This action doesn't have a default name or profile picture for the webhook.

1. Click **Copy Webhook URL** and save it for later. (Or you can come back here and copy it again!)

### Configure Repository Secrets

> [!WARNING]
> You can skip this step and add these values directly in the `.yaml` file,
> but exposing Discord user IDs and the webhook URL is NEVER a good idea.

1. On your GitHub repository page, go to **Settings** and click **Secrets and variables > Actions**.
   ![github secrets](docs/github-secrets.png)
1. Under **Repository secrets**, click **New Repository Secret**.
   ![github repository secrets](docs/github-repository-secrets.png)
1. Name it `WEBHOOK_URL` and paste your Discord Webhook URL.
1. Create another secret named `USERNAMES`, and the secret should contain the usernames for reviewers.

The format should be:

```
githubusername1:discorduserid1
githubusername2:discorduserid2
githubusername3:discorduserid3
```

and so on. To find a Discord User ID, follow [this official document](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID).

### Add Action Configuration File

Create a file `.github/workflows/random-reviewer.yaml` and paste the following:

```yaml
name: Random Reviewer Discord

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - reopened
      - ready_for_review
      - review_requested
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request_review:
    types:
      - submitted
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 10 * * 6

permissions:
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  assign-reviewer:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Assign random reviewer
        uses: JedBeom/random-reviewer-discord@v0.2.0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          usernames: ${{ secrets.USERNAMES }}
          webhook_url: ${{ secrets.WEBHOOK_URL }}
          remind_prs_min_age: 24
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget to add `permissions`! This action only requires `pull-requests: write`.

> [!NOTE]
> For more options and descriptions, see [action.yml](./action.yml).

Add the file, commit it to a new branch, push it, and create a PR.

## Customize It

### Supported Events and Activity Types

This action supports the following events:

- [pull_request](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request) ([Webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#pull_request))
  - opened
  - reopened
  - ready_for_review
  - review_requested
- [pull_requested](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_review) ([Webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#pull_request_review))
  - submitted
- [schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule)

Other types would be ignored.

### Exclude Some Usernames

You may want to exclude some users from the usernames. Add `#` in front of the line to exclude them.

For example, if `user2` should be excluded,

```
user1:1111111111111111111
#user2:2222222222222222222
user3:3333333333333333333
```

adding `#` in front of `user2`'s line makes the action ignore them. Remove `#` if you want to include them again.

### Edit the Message

You can customize the Discord message using the `template_*` inputs.
See [action.yml](./action.yml) for the list of templates and examples.

Each templates except `template_schedule` supports the following variables:

- `{mention}`: Mention of the reviewer(s). For `pull_request_review.submitted`, this is the mention of the author.
  - Example: `<@1111111111111111111>` or `<@1111111111111111111> <@2222222222222222222>`
- `{prTitle}`: The title of the pull request.
  - Example: `Remove unused dependencies`
- `{prNumber}`: Number uniquely identifying the pull request within its repository.
  - Example: `314`
- `{prURL}`: URL of the pull request.
  - Example: `https://github.com/JedBeom/random-reviewer-discord/pull/9`
